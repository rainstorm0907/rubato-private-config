# Outpost

The local session owns the question, the packet, and verification. `outpost` owns
the ChatGPT project send. Do not assemble engine flags, and do not hand the
packet to another browser or agent.

`outpost` ships with this skill and is the only sender. Confirm the command
before trusting remembered flags: `command -v outpost`.

## When

Use Outpost when the main quality bottleneck is depth: difficult research,
synthesis, architecture, diagnosis, or independent judgment. It can find and
evaluate public sources while reasoning. When evidence coverage is equally
material, put the evidence collected through Aside in the packet first. Skip it
for code that depends on local services or private repo state the sandbox
cannot reach.

## Quality

`outpost send` takes one of two qualities, and they are different products:

- `--quality pro` — ChatGPT's `Pro` tier with the `GPT-6` model. Runs `gpt-6-pro`;
  the only quality a packet worth an Outpost run gets. A turn can run 15–20
  minutes and each send spends weekly Pro quota: send once, never re-send.
- `--quality xhigh` — ChatGPT's `Extra High` tier. Runs `gpt-6-thinking`, so it
  is cheaper and enough to prove the plumbing end to end, but it is not a Pro
  answer. Never hand a Pro-quality question to it.

Each quality has exactly one expected model slug, and the run fails with exit
`78` when ChatGPT reports anything else, so a picker change cannot pass unnoticed.

## Packet

Write `.outpost/<run>/packet.md`. The first line is one Markdown H1 with only
the subject (`# <title>`). Do not add task framing such as `Outpost`,
`review request`, `검토`, `리뷰 요청`, or `분석 요청`. Include the evidence,
constraints, failed attempts, and acceptance criteria that can change the
answer. Scan for secrets. Ask for a natural Korean report; leave structure
and terms to the consultant.

To receive a generated zip back, add `--artifact .outpost/<run>/artifact.zip`.
To upload extra input files with the packet, add `--attach <path>` (repeatable).
Non-ASCII upload names, including names inside a zip, are renamed to ASCII
because ChatGPT mangles them; the mapping is appended to the packet.

Complex packets: `references/context-checklist.md`.

## Command

```bash
outpost list
outpost doctor
outpost send --quality pro .outpost/<run>/packet.md
outpost send --quality pro .outpost/<run>/packet.md --attach .outpost/<run>/evidence.zip
outpost send --quality pro .outpost/<run>/packet.md --to <thread-id>
outpost send --quality xhigh .outpost/<run>/packet.md
outpost recover .outpost/<run>/result.json
```

`--to` accepts a thread id, `last`, a `/c/` conversation URL, or `result.json`.
List first; `last` is the newest thread that already has a conversation.
Unrelated threads may run in parallel. The same thread serializes.
While a send is in flight, `outpost list` shows `working`. Background the
process; when it exits, an idle parent session is woken.

## After

Read `response.md` and `result.json` together. Confirm the request marker and response belong to this turn; topical similarity alone does not resolve a mismatched id. Recover existing output before any resend. A matched, supported challenge to your framing is relevant even when it rejects your preferred answer. Verify claims that change the next action and use `references/after-advice.md` for synthesis inside authority.

- Exit `75` — nothing was sent, proven (stopped before the prompt was typed, or
  no turn with this run's ID in the project). Report the stage and stop; resend
  the same packet once `outpost doctor` is green.
- Exit `76` — not provable either way. Do not resend; `outpost recover` finds
  the turn by ID and saves the answer (`0`), proves it unsent (`75`), or stays `76`.
- Exit `77` — the turn committed but the reply was not saved. Run
  `outpost recover`. Never resend that packet. A later `--to` is a new turn,
  not a resend.
- Exit `78` — the answer was saved but ChatGPT ran a model other than the one
  this quality expects. Do not act on it as the quality you asked for; run
  `outpost doctor`.
- Exit `79` — this run directory already sent this packet. Recover it instead
  of sending again; `OUTPOST_FORCE=1` overrides only when you mean to spend
  another Pro turn.

`result.json` is written before the send with `status: submitted_pending` and
the project URL, so a dead REPL, an Aside restart, or a killed parent never
loses the turn: `outpost recover .outpost/<run>` (older runs: `--url <project>`)
picks the answer up without resending.

Engine, Chat surface, recovery, and project config live in
`references/runbook.md`.
