# Installation Notes

This is the explicit Playwright fallback. The normal `outpost` skill does not
install or load it. Invoke it from the canonical repository only after the Aside
path fails or when strict agbrowse/code-artifact recovery is required.

## Codex

Install as a personal skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -R outpost-playwright ~/.agents/skills/outpost-playwright
```

Or install as a project skill:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R outpost-playwright .agents/skills/outpost-playwright
```

Install `agbrowse` before using the web execution path:

```bash
npm install -g agbrowse
```

When verified provider drift requires a newer `agbrowse`, review the release evidence and obtain authorization before changing the global install:

```bash
npm install -g agbrowse@latest
```

Use from a desktop session because this skill attaches to one shared local headed Chrome profile. The ZIP includes the owner and runtime checker:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_outpost_runtime.py
python3 scripts/ensure_outpost_chrome.py --ensure
```

The packaged runtime fixes CDP to `127.0.0.1:9222` and uses `~/.codex/browser-profiles/outpost-agbrowse/browser-profile`. Every helper forces `AGBROWSE_WEB_AI_AUTO_START=0`, so `agbrowse` cannot create another browser. `OUTPOST_BROWSER_AGENT_HOME` is available only for an intentional installation-level relocation; all concurrent calls must use the same value.

The helper reads the Work project URL from `OUTPOST_CHATGPT_URL` first, then from `~/.codex/outpost.env`.

Outpost packets are sent by file upload by default. The helper saves the latest web-ai `sessionId` in `.outpost/agbrowse-outpost-session.json` so later follow-up questions can continue the same outpost conversation.

Invoke explicitly:

```text
$outpost-playwright recover the failed Aside outpost through agbrowse and save the verified response under .outpost/
```

## Claude Code

Install as a personal skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R outpost-playwright ~/.claude/skills/outpost-playwright
```

Or install as a project skill:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R outpost-playwright .claude/skills/outpost-playwright
```

Claude Code environments without `agbrowse`, Google Chrome, and access to the packaged local headed Chrome owner can still write packet and prompt files, but they cannot complete the required automatic web submission and response capture. Do not fall back to private endpoints, token extraction, hosted browsers, stealth, or API calls.

For explicit-only Claude invocation, add this line to `SKILL.md` frontmatter after installation if your Claude runtime supports it:

```yaml
disable-model-invocation: true
```
