# Dispatching

Run this when you are about to hand work to another session (a teammate, a subagent, a freehand worker on any lane), and when you are about to send the next task to a session that already exists. It shapes the brief you are composing and the choice of who receives it; it is not a template to fill.

## What binds, and what is a lead

The force of a sentence comes from its content kind and the source of its authority, never from its tone.

Binding: the things you are the canon of:

- The outcome and why it matters.
- Done evidence: what will count as done for this outcome.
- Write ownership and off-limits paths; these protect other sessions' work.
- The budget: the elapsed time, spend, or scope growth at which the worker returns even though nothing is blocked. Name a number, and say that returning at budget with the surface still open is a valid completion.
- Constraints that carry a named authority source: the user asked for it, a spec or active frame states it, an external contract or another session's ownership requires it. Name the source next to the constraint.
- Frozen items: values, behaviors, feels, layouts, or copy the user has locked ("keep this", "do not touch", "freeze"). List each one in the brief with its source and date ("physics constants and the formula that uses them: frozen, user, 2026-08-14"). A frozen item that lives only in a document the worker was not told to read does not exist for that worker. If the task cannot be completed without changing a frozen item, the worker stops and returns with that conflict; it does not choose between the task and the freeze, and it does not satisfy the freeze by leaving the old value in a comment while replacing what uses it.

Provisional: everything you believe about how the code is shaped: file coordinates, call paths, causal guesses, method ideas, suggested files to inspect. Ship them when they help (verified knowledge from earlier runs saves the worker a cold read), but they travel as leads the worker verifies against code, tests, and runtime, and may overrule. Being able to quote the line does not upgrade a lead: a correctly quoted line can still be a wrong interpretation. Provisionality does not survive serialization unless your register carries it; a guess shipped as fact pins the search to the wrong spot.

Why frozen items need their own line: when a task and a rule conflict inside a worker, the task wins, because the task is what the worker is measured on. A rule arriving as background prose reads as a preference; the same rule arriving as a named fence with a stop instruction reads as a boundary.

A quality concern you invented yourself is not a constraint. State it as something observable to verify (a measurement, a behavior), because a mechanism prohibition written without reading the code can forbid the only fix.

Keep read scope apart from write scope. "Look at these files" is a lead; "do not write these files" is a fence. Do not mix them in one list.

Two boundary cases, drawn from a real incident:

- Invented constraint → observable: "Do not widen the cache invalidation" forbade the only fix. "Widen it if you must; measure the repaint delta and report it" keeps the same performance concern and lets the worker move.
- Lead vs fence: "`transcript_blocks.zig` is probably where entries are assembled; verify" is a lead the worker may overrule. "`runtime.zig` is held by another session today; do not write it" is a fence, and stays one even if the worker disagrees.

## The receiving end

A worker whose session loads a role contract already knows how to read this brief. A worker that loads none (a freehand lane, an ad-hoc helper) gets one line instead: start by reading Skill(dispatched). Where that skill cannot reach the worker's harness, carry the license inline: repo claims here are provisional; verify them; a conflict with a binding line returns with evidence and a recommendation; at budget, return what you covered; no finding is a valid result.

The return contract has a fixed column when frozen items were listed, with three values: `Frozen items touched: none`, `Frozen items touched: <which>, <why the task required it>`, or `Frozen items: list unavailable, <why>` (the brief named a list the worker could not read, or the repository's frozen list could not be found). "Unavailable" is not "none"; a worker that could not read the list reports that, and does not report `none`. A return without this column when the brief listed frozen items is incomplete. This column makes the worker check the list before returning; it is a self-report, not evidence. Where the repository carries frozen checks, the checks are the evidence, and a self-report of `none` does not replace running them.

When the surface is visual or felt (a screen, a sound, a control feel), the return contract also stops at the first rendered state: the worker returns with screenshots or a recording after the first render, and does not continue to a second implementation turn on that surface until the user has seen the first. Say this in the brief even when the worker loads the frontend rules, because a worker on a freehand lane loads none; a worker that is not told to stop will finish. A worker that stops here has completed its turn; see "When it comes back empty".

## Reuse the agent or start a new one

Part of every dispatch is choosing who gets it. If an agent already worked on this same problem, send the next task to that agent: it has already read the files, and a new one would read them all again. This holds when the work moves from looking to building, from building to fixing a failed test, or when you changed your mind about the approach after seeing its report.

Start a new agent for three reasons only: you want a second opinion that has not seen the first agent's thinking (a reviewer), the task is about a different problem, or the old agent is stuck on a wrong idea it cannot let go of. A reviewer starting cold is the point, not a cost. A stronger model being available is not one of the three; once you have decided on a new agent, Skill(model-guide) picks its model.

If `AgentSend` says the agent cannot be continued (it was evicted, cancelled, crashed, or expired), start a new one and pass along whatever the old one left behind (its report, files, evidence) as leads to verify. If nothing was left, say so in the brief.

## While it is out

A stalled worker has a shape you can see from outside: budget draining while nothing new appears (no edit, no test, no narrowed hypothesis appropriate to the task) and the same surface being read again. That shape, not elapsed time alone, is the signal.

Cut in and ask. Asked directly, a worker usually knows exactly what blocked it, and the answer arrives in one exchange where another hour of silence would have produced nothing. Steering keeps the thread, as above; a replacement pays a cold read for the same brief.

## When it comes back empty

A dispatch that ends without the artifact its task type should produce (no edit or test for a build, no anchor or narrowed hypothesis for an investigation, no verdict for a review) is not finished, and not a reason to spawn the next worker. A visual or felt surface is the exception: a return after the first rendered state, carrying screenshots and the points to judge, has produced its artifact. That is a completed turn, not an empty one; the next move is showing it to the user, not resending the brief. For everything else: Recover the cause from the same session first. Ask which premise or constraint blocked it, with evidence. Classify (infrastructure failure, oversized surface, brief conflict, misrouting) before anything is resent. An unchanged brief handed to a new worker carries the shared cause with it; a worker swap is not a frame change.
