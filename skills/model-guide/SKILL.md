# Model Guide

Choose a child's model by the work's dominant bottleneck, not by phase labels or permanent job titles. This guide has two layers: cognitive profiles that are durable across model generations, and an operational note pinned to a date that you replace when the catalog changes.

Evidence base: `/Users/wy/Github-repos/agent-taskforce/research/2026-08-20-model-cognition-column.md` — read it when revising this skill, not during a run.

## 1. Preserve outcome ownership

An owner keeps a bounded outcome through investigation, implementation, retries, and local verification.

- The model that proves a root cause normally patches it too.
- Do not hand work from an investigator to a builder merely because the phase changed from diagnosis to implementation.
- Hand off only when the remaining work is a clean, substantial outcome that can be specified without the original investigation context, and the new model's advantage outweighs rereading and translation cost.
- For large repetitive rollout after a difficult diagnosis, prefer delegation under the original owner. Transfer full ownership only when the rollout is genuinely independent.

## 2. Cognitive profiles (durable)

Frontier models are not one IQ ladder; they differ in which kind of uncertainty they handle well.

| Profile | Core loop | Strongest at | Characteristic failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Problem framer / human modeler** | keeps ambiguity open, models the person behind the request | UX, strategy, writing, co-defining what should be built | over-expansion, grand theories |
| **Structurer / integrator** | orients in unfamiliar environments, decomposes and integrates long work | architecture, workstream boundaries, final integration | technical elegance overriding human purpose |
| **Hypothesis converger** | problem → hypothesis → evidence → refutation → narrower hypothesis | root cause, invariants, algorithms, performance, verification | premature convergence on a wrong framing, then optimizing inside it |
| **Action converger** | goal → act → observe → fix → act → done | settled changes rolled across many files, tools, prototypes | weak at discovering goals or reframing the problem |

Route by asking: **what part is hardest to get right?**

| Dominant bottleneck | Owner profile |
|---|---|
| Understanding people, product value, or what should be built | problem framer — usually a framing step or human dialogue, not a standing teammate |
| Cross-stream architecture, contracts, integration | structurer — often the lead itself |
| Discovering and proving the correct technical change | hypothesis converger |
| Executing a settled change across tools, files, runtime | action converger |
| Falsifying a material implementation | fresh verifier with a *different* profile from the writer |

Two convergers are not interchangeable: a hypothesis converger compresses the answer space, an action converger compresses the action space. A patch built by an action converger is well checked by a hypothesis converger — their failure modes rarely overlap. Neither substitutes for a framer when the variables of the problem are themselves undecided.

## 3. Current catalog mapping (operational — verify against the live catalog)

Pinned 2026-08. Names are replaceable mappings, not universal claims. Copy exact model ids from the live catalog at spawn time, never from this file or memory.

- **Fable 5** — problem framer. Optional framing and human-outcome review before execution or at a rare alignment gate; do not create a standing Fable teammate by default.
- **Opus 5** — structurer. Strong default lead and default owner; may own a highly coupled architectural outcome.
- **GPT-5.6 Sol** — hypothesis converger. Owner when root-cause discovery, algorithmic reasoning, invariants, performance diagnosis, or proof is the hard part; if Sol finds the cause, Sol implements the fix and regression test. Operator note (2026-08): Sol quota is the scarcer wallet — reserve Sol ownership for workstreams where that loop is genuinely the bottleneck; Opus is the default owner otherwise.
- **Grok 4.6** — action converger. Owner when the contract is settled and breadth of execution is the hard part. A regular child like any other (`task` with a model, or `team_create` with category `grok`), not a separate CLI lane.

Verifier defaults when an independent check is worth the cost:

- Opus-owned implementation → Sol verifier
- Sol-owned technical fix → fresh Opus or another strong different-model verifier
- Opus-owned architectural change → Sol verifier

Defaults, not mandatory pairings. A clear low-risk task may use owner self-verification only.

## 4. Minimal shapes

- One bounded technical outcome → one owner.
- One material or ambiguous outcome → owner + verifier.
- Two genuinely independent outcomes → two owners; verifier only if integration risk warrants.
- Unclear root cause → one hypothesis-converger owner first; competing hypotheses only when evidence paths are genuinely separable.
- Product or UX uncertainty → framing before execution, then the chosen owners.

Do not build a four-model org chart just because all models are available.

## Scope

This skill owns model-to-work routing only. Team governance — roster approval, mission, contracts, completion — belongs to Skill(agent-taskforce). Brief-writing belongs to Skill(dispatching). Prompt structure and effort selection belong to claude-prompting-lab.
